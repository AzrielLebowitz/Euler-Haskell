# euler
This repository contains solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, implemented in Haskell using concise one-line functions.

Each solution is written using only single line functions, showcasing the power and expressiveness of Haskell & functional programming.

## Requirements

To run the Haskell solutions, you need to have the following installed:

- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
- [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) (Haskell build tool)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository

2. Edit src/Lib.hs to import whatever euler problem you want to run.

3. Run `stack run .` in main folder
